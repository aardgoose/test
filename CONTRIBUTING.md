## Pull requests

Please follow these rules when submitting pull requests (PR):

* make PRs as atomic as possible (don't combine unrelated changes or features into one PR)
* the PR should include all necessary documentation updates (summary of the changes in the file 
[CHANGES](https://github.com/therion/therion/blob/master/CHANGES), 
all the details in the [thbook](https://github.com/therion/therion/tree/master/thbook)). 
Please try to be consistent with the style of existing documentation.
